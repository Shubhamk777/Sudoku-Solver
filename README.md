# Sudoku-Solver

#Project Overview
The Sudoku Solver is a web-based application that solves any given Sudoku puzzle. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their puzzle, and the solver will automatically find and display the solution using an efficient backtracking algorithm.

#Features
   ->User Input: Users can manually input Sudoku puzzles.
   ->Real-time Solution: Once the puzzle is submitted, the solver displays the solution instantly.
   ->Efficient Algorithm: Utilizes backtracking to solve the puzzle in an optimized way.
   ->Error Handling: Detects and handles invalid Sudoku inputs.

   #Tech Stack
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Algorithm: Backtracking implemented in JavaScript

   ##How It Works
   ->The user inputs the numbers in the 9x9 Sudoku grid.
    ->Once submitted, the backtracking algorithm processes the grid, recursively placing numbers while ensuring the Sudoku rules are followed.
    ->The algorithm backtracks when a conflict arises and    continues searching for the correct solution.
    ->The final solved Sudoku puzzle is displayed to the user.
